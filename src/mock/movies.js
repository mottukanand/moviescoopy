Amid a climate of science denial and a well-funded corporate behemoth, three Kentuckians (a local geologist, an ex-creationist, and an atheist activist) try their best to challenge the movement that is taking over their home state.  Meanwhile, fervent believers work diligently to create the lifelike animatronics that will be on display in the Ark. Leaving judgement aside, this documentary challenges the deep-seated doctrine that is passed down among creationists, pitting scientific fact vs. religious belief.",
